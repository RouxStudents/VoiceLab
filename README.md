# VoiceLab

The **Voice and Conversational AI Lab** is a new initiative launched by **Roux Students** (a [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/) at Northeastern University's new [Roux Insitutue](https://roux.northeastern.edu/)) in partnership with the **Humanitarian AI** and **Princeton School of AI** meetup groups.

The Lab is an all-volunteer initiative created to collaborate with students from across the **GDSC** network, private sector companies, nonprofits, academic research labs and others on carrying out voice and conversational AI research vital to the humanitarian community and the advancement of humanitarian AI applications.

The Lab principally works on developing **datasets** needed to train digital assistants how to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors and on prototyping **voice applications** for training, testing and evaluation. Work is geared to support concerted humanitarian-community-wide efforts focusing on standardizing how aid activities are reported and making data accessible to machine applications.

## Datasets

Datasets we're currently working on:

Datasets | Description
---- | ----
Annotation Tags | List of tags to use to annotate humanitarian data for training voice applications
Sector Codes | Dataset containing audio clips, transcriptions and metadata generated from volunteers reading descriptive information taken from lists of humanitarian purpose and activity codes
Humanitarian Keywords and Terms | List of keywords and terms widely used across the humannitarian and development communities and a dataset containing spoken versions of these in local field operational languages
Queries and Commands | List of questions and cammands humanitarian actors might like to ask digital assistants and a corresponding list of what informal outputs humanitarian actors would ideally like to see returned

## Data Partners Program

The Lab is recruiting humanitarian organizations through its **Data Partners Program** to provide key aid activity data needed to help improve AI training datasets and to consult on training and testing outputs. Staff from organizations can register to participate via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctRp_vi-Bf5NepyIL2UvZIWgI6ekwQUa7YDRvfgSTXq3X5rw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Voice Applications

The Lab is currently developing a partnership with Stanford University's [Open Virtual Assistant Lab](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/) to build an assistant to train and test.

## The International Aid Transparency Initiative

The Lab is concentrating on researching and developing ways information streaming through open data sharing frameworks used by humanitarian actors can power voice applications, in particular data streaming through IATI (a framework developed by the humanitarian community through the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](https://iatistandard.org/en/)), the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) and [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/). The Lab is also highly interested in work being carried out by the [Humanitarian Exchange Langauge](https://hxlstandard.org/) initiative, the [Center for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/), [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/), [Omdena](https://omdena.com/), [Deep](https://thedeep.io/), the [Humanitarian Data Science and Ethics Group](https://www.hum-dseg.org/), and other initiatives. 

## Get Involved

We'll be coordinating lab work through [Roux Students](https://gdsc.community.dev/northeastern-university-portland/) and the [Humanitarian AI](https://humanitarianai.org) and [Princeton School of AI](https://www.meetup.com/Princeton-School-of-AI/) meetup groups. The VoiceLab is an all-volunteer initiative open to anyone with an interest in getting involved regardless of their technical proficiency. Get in touch via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5hMIJYrga7gk3tavB_e81cSabDUHhsWc3wmOBbWwpm1bQ1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) or follow and direct message us through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RouxStudents).
