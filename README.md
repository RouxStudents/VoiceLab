# Voice Lab

**Roux Students** is partnering with other **Google Developer Clubs**, members of the **Humanitarian AI** and **Princeton School of AI** meetup groups and others to start work on developing datasets needed to help train digital assistants how to process and answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

## Datasets

We'll list datasets that we're working on here:

Datasets | Description
---- | ----
[Sector Codes](https://github.com/RouxStudents/Voice-Lab/blob/main/SectorCodes.md) | Dataset containing audio clips, transcriptions and metadata generated from volunteers reading descriptive information taken from humanitarian purpose and activity codes

## IATI, ReliefWeb, Humanitarian Data Exchange, Humanitarian Exchange Language

Humanitarian actors have been working concertedly to standardize how aid activities are reported and develop channels needed to make the information accessible to machine applications. These efforts are set to make vast amounts of highly structured aid activity information accessible to emerging voice applications and popular digital assistants like Siri and Alexa.

Datasets generated by the Voice Lab will principally facilitate the discovery and processing of information reported in compliance with the [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/), stored in repositories like the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) or posted on [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/). The project will also take into considerations tools widely used across the humanitarian community created by the [Humanitarian Exchange Langauge](https://hxlstandard.org/), [OECD-DAC](https://www.oecd.org/dac/) and other initiatives.

## Aims and Objectives

The Voice Lab aims to facilitate and support work needed to give digital assistants the ability to process queries posed by humanitarian actors through systematically developing training and testing datasets needed by artificial intelligent applications.

## Get Involved

We'll be coordinating the project through **GitHub** and the [Roux Students](https://www.meetup.com/roux-students/), [Humanitarian AI](https://humanitarianai.org) and [Princeton School of AI](https://www.meetup.com/Princeton-School-of-AI/) meetup groups. Consider joining a group to get involved or follow and direct message us through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RouxStudents).
