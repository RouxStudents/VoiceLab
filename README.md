# VoiceLab

The **Voice and Conversational AI Lab** is a new initiative launched by **Roux Students**, a [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/) started by students from Northeastern University's new [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), in partnership with the [Humanitarian AI](https://humanitarianai.org) and [Princeton School of AI](https://www.meetup.com/Princeton-School-of-AI) meetup groups.

The all-volunteer lab collaborates with students from across the **GDSC** network, companies, nonprofits, academic institutions and others on carrying out **voice** and **conversational AI** research vital to the humanitarian community and the advancement of humanitarian AI applications.

The lab principally works on developing **backend resources** and **datasets** needed to train virtual assistants how to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors and on prototyping voice applications for testing, supporting humanitarian-community-wide efforts standardizing reporting and making data openly accessible to machine applications.

## Projects

Current VoiceLab projects:

Projects | Description
---- | ----
TagSet | Project will generate annotation tags to label humanitarian data for training natural language processing models.
HumanitarianCorpus | Project will work on creating custom text corpora relevant to the humanitarian field useful for pre-training and fine-tuning NLP models
HumanitarianExchange | Project will research and test ways of improving humanitarian data storage and access to support sophisticated research and AI applications development activities
HumanitarianQuestions | Project will synthesize and aggregate human created questions and commands useful for training and testing humanitarian AI applications, including virtual assistants
HumanitarianBERT | Project will experiment with using transformers like BERT to train text classifiers and natural language processing models to identify ways humanitarian question and answering can be improved 
OpenAssistant | Project will collaborate with Stanford’s Open Virtual Assistant Lab on prototyping an open virtual assistant to test humanitarian applications
AlexaChallenge | Project will work with Amazon and Alexa Prize competitors to develop and launch an Alexa Humanitarianbot challenge

## Data Partners Program

The Lab is recruiting humanitarian organizations through its Data Partners Program to join the lab and help aggregate and improve questions and answers and contribute data needed to train AI applications. Staff from organizations can register to participate via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctRp_vi-Bf5NepyIL2UvZIWgI6ekwQUa7YDRvfgSTXq3X5rw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## The International Aid Transparency Initiative

The Lab is concentrating on research and developing ways information streaming through open data sharing frameworks used by humanitarian actors can power voice applications, in particular data streaming through IATI (a framework developed by the humanitarian community through the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](https://iatistandard.org/en/)), the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) and [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/). The Lab is also highly interested in work being carried out by the [Humanitarian Exchange Langauge](https://hxlstandard.org/) initiative, the [Center for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/), [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/), [Omdena](https://omdena.com/), [Deep](https://thedeep.io/), the [Humanitarian Data Science and Ethics Group](https://www.hum-dseg.org/), and other initiatives. 

## Get Involved

We'll be coordinating lab work through **Roux Students** and the **Humanitarian AI** and **Princeton School of AI** meetup groups. The VoiceLab is an all-volunteer initiative open to anyone with an interest in getting involved involved regardless of their technical proficiency. Get in touch via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5hMIJYrga7gk3tavB_e81cSabDUHhsWc3wmOBbWwpm1bQ1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) or direct message VoiceLab team members through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RouxStudents).
