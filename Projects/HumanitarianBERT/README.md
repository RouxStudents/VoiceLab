# HumanitarianBERT

This project will experiment with using transformers like BERT to train text classifiers and natural language processing models to identify ways humanitarian question and answering can be improved.

## Projects

To get started, our first project will focus on building a [SectorCoder](https://github.com/RouxStudents/VoiceLab/tree/main/Projects/SectorCoder)able to classify and assign sector codes to humanitarian aid activities, creating additional pathways humanitarian AI applications can traverse.
